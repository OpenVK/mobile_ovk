# OpenVK Mobile (theme)
Mobile theme for OpenVK that ~~cosplays~~ imitates the old m.vk.com design. _Only modern browsers supported._

## Compatibility

It should work with Chandler with version that not predates 8345b43 commit (or 27 January of 2022).

It is also compatible with browsers which versions were released after 2016. It works fine in modern Firefox, Chromium, Mypal (both on Pale Moon and Firefox base), Internet Explorer 11 and Legacy Edge (aka EdgeHTML).

## Installation
In the `themepacks` folder (in the root folder of OpenVK), run this command: `git clone https://github.com/openvk/mobile_ovk`. That's all.
